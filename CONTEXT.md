# CONTEXT.md

Current working state of the repository. Keep this short and current; see
`README.md` for the project and `AGENTS.md` for the engineering rules.

## Current milestone

Interval 5 — live on-device transcription. Complete.

## Current implementation

- Domain value types in `ScribeKit/Models/`: `MeetingState`,
  `AudioRetentionMode`, `CaptureSource`, `MeetingSession`, `AudioCaptureState`,
  and new for this interval `TranscriptSegment` (with a `RecognitionState` of
  partial or final), `TranscriptionEvent` / `TranscriptionInterruption`,
  `TranscriptionState` and `SpeechRecognitionAvailability`.
- `ScribeKit/Capture/`: discovery unchanged. `CapturedAudioSample` is now
  `CapturedPCMBuffer` and carries the frames; `CapturedAudioSampleAdapter` is
  now `CapturedPCMBufferAdapter`. `AudioSampleConsuming` takes a
  `CapturedPCMBuffer`, and `BroadcastingAudioSampleConsumer` fans one capture
  stream out to several consumers. `ScreenCaptureKitAudioCapturer` is
  otherwise unchanged.
- `ScribeKit/Transcription/`: `SpeechTranscribing` with `TranscriptionError`,
  `TranscriptionConfiguration` / `TranscriptionLocale`, `BoundedAudioQueue`
  (generic, fixed-capacity, an `AsyncSequence`), `SpeechAudioConverter`,
  `TranscriptionAudioInput` (conversion, run-relative timing and the bounded
  backlog) and `AppleSpeechTranscriber`, an actor owning the `SpeechAnalyzer`.
- `ScribeKit/Features/MeetingSetup/`: `LiveTranscriptModel` owns the finalised
  segments and the single partial hypothesis; `MeetingSetupCaptureModel` is now
  the pipeline coordinator, owning capture, recognition, locale, availability
  and the ordering between them; `MeetingSetupView` adds a Capture &
  Transcription section and a lazily rendered Live Transcript section, and
  keeps Start Meeting disabled.
- `ScribeKitTests/`: Swift Testing suites (170 tests, 24 suites).

No transcript writing, autosave, recovery or background behaviour exists.
Nothing is written to the chosen folder, and no audio or transcript file is
created anywhere.

## Speech API decision

`SpeechAnalyzer` with a `SpeechTranscriber` module, from the Speech framework.

- The deployment target is macOS 26.5 and these types are available from
  macOS 26.0, so nothing was raised to reach them. `SFSpeechRecognizer` was
  rejected: it is the older API and has a server-backed path, which this
  project must not have.
- It streams: the analyzer consumes an `AsyncSequence<AnalyzerInput>` and
  publishes results as they settle.
- It is on-device by construction. Recognition runs against a model in
  `SpeechTranscriber.installedLocales`; there is no network mode to fall back
  to and no flag that would enable one.
- It supports contextual hints through `AnalysisContext.contextualStrings`,
  which `TranscriptionConfiguration.contextualStrings` is wired to. ScribeKit
  ships none, so recognition output is the recogniser's own.
- It needs no permission. Verified live: transcription ran with
  `SFSpeechRecognizer.authorizationStatus()` at `notDetermined`, with no
  prompt, inside the sandboxed app. No Info.plist usage description was added,
  because none is required and asking for one ScribeKit does not need would be
  worse than asking for nothing.

## Local recognition guarantee

Four independent things hold it up:

1. `AppleSpeechTranscriber` refuses to start unless the chosen locale's model
   is in `installedLocales`; otherwise it reports `.modelNotInstalled` and
   nothing starts.
2. Model assets are never downloaded. `AssetInventory.assetInstallationRequest`
   exists and is deliberately not called; it returned a non-nil request even
   for an already-installed locale, so it is not a reliable readiness signal
   either. `AssetInventory.status` was `.supported` for a locale that
   `installedLocales` listed, so `installedLocales` is the gate.
3. `SFSpeechRecognizer` is not referenced anywhere in the app target.
4. The app carries no `com.apple.security.network.client` entitlement, so the
   sandbox does not permit it to open a socket. Verified live: `lsof -a -p
   <pid> -i` listed nothing while transcribing.

## Audio format

- ScreenCaptureKit delivers 48 000 Hz, 1 channel, float32, non-interleaved, in
  960-frame (20 ms) buffers, unchanged from Interval 4.
- The recogniser's `availableCompatibleAudioFormats` is exactly two entries:
  16 000 Hz and 8 000 Hz, 1 channel, Int16, interleaved.
  `SpeechAnalyzer.bestAvailableAudioFormat` returns 16 kHz Int16 even when a
  48 kHz float format is offered as the natural one. Conversion is therefore
  required, not chosen.
- One `AVAudioConverter` is built per run and reused; it is rebuilt only if the
  capture format changes. Conversion happens on ScreenCaptureKit's serial
  delivery queue, never on the main actor. The 48 kHz to 16 kHz ratio is exact,
  so 960 frames in gives 320 out after the resampler primes on the first
  buffer.

## PCM ownership

`CapturedPCMBuffer` holds one buffer's frames as `[Float]`, copied out of the
`CMSampleBuffer` while its callback is on the stack, because that memory is not
valid afterwards. It is the smallest copy that makes safe asynchronous
ownership possible: 960 floats, under 4 KB, released as soon as its consumers
have run. The peak level is measured with vDSP in the same pass, so the frames
are read once. No `CMSampleBuffer` is retained past its callback, and no PCM is
accumulated anywhere.

## Backpressure policy

`TranscriptionAudioInput` converts each buffer on the delivery queue and
appends it to a `BoundedAudioQueue` of 150 converted buffers — about three
seconds, roughly 96 KB — which the analyzer drains as an `AsyncSequence`.
Appending never waits.

When the queue is full the **oldest** buffer is evicted, so recognition stays
as close to live as the backlog allows and what is lost is audio it had already
fallen behind on. Each converted buffer carries the time of its first frame
counted from the first frame of the run, so an eviction leaves a real gap in
the timeline rather than sliding everything after it forward. Lost time is
accumulated and reported as `.interrupted(.audioDropped)` once it reaches half
a second, and the remainder is flushed at stop, so a badly behind recogniser
produces a readable statement rather than one event per buffer. The interface
states the total as untranscribed seconds.

## Partial and final semantics

The recogniser reports a volatile hypothesis for the span being spoken and,
when it settles, a finalised span covering it. Observed live: ten partials
growing word by word, then one final for the sentence. `LiveTranscriptModel`
therefore keeps finalised segments in an array and the partial as a single
value that each new partial replaces, so five hypotheses leave one entry.
Recognised text is stored exactly as returned; only display trims the space
that joins one span to the previous one.

## Interruption and recovery

- A recogniser that stops by itself surfaces as
  `.interrupted(.recognitionFailed)`. The coordinator restarts it at most twice
  while capture continues, and records the time it was down as untranscribed.
  Beyond that the run is reported as failed rather than retried forever. This
  path is unit tested; it has not been observed live, because the recogniser
  did not fail.
- A capture stream that stops by itself moves capture to `failed` and stops
  recognition, which has nothing left to transcribe.
- Stopping stops capture first, then finalises recognition, so the last
  sentence is not lost and no audio arrives after the input closes.
- A run that accepted no audio at all never ends its results sequence — proved
  with a standalone harness. The wait for it is bounded at two seconds and the
  task is then cancelled, so a stop can never hang. A cancelled results task is
  not reported as a recogniser failure.

## Locale behaviour

`TranscriptionConfiguration.localeIdentifier` is explicit and BCP-47. The
screen offers every locale `SpeechTranscriber.supportedLocales` reports, marks
the ones whose model is not installed, and disables the picker during a run.
The default is the system locale when the recogniser supports it, otherwise the
first installed locale. Nothing detects or switches language on its own.

This Mac: 30 supported locales, 9 installed (all `en-*`).

## Validation status

`xcodebuild ... test` passes on Xcode 26.6: **170 tests in 24 suites**, no
compiler warnings. The `AppleSpeechTranscriber` suite starts and stops the real
recogniser twice, which is where its 4.2 s comes from — two bounded drains of a
run that received no audio.

Live validation used a purpose-built looping player application (outside the
repository) speaking seven sentences about Swift closures, captured as the only
selected source.

- Capture: 48 000 Hz mono float32 non-interleaved, ~50 buffers/second,
  peak 37–44%, unchanged from Interval 4.
- Recognition started with no permission prompt and reported "Transcribing on
  device".
- The transcript filled with one finalised entry per sentence, each with its
  offset from the start of the run, and one italic partial below them. Over
  ~2 minutes no partial hypothesis became an entry.
- Recognition is honest about what it heard: "async and await" came back as
  "asking and await" and was left alone. ScribeKit does not correct it.
- Stop froze the counters and returned both subsystems to idle; a second start
  produced a fresh transcript on a fresh timeline from 00:00.
- `lsof -a -p <pid> -i` listed no sockets while transcribing, and no regular
  file was open for writing. The app's container held no `.md`, `.caf`, `.m4a`
  or `session.json` afterwards.
- A ~15 minute continuous run, of which 9.5 minutes were sampled every 15 s
  with `top`: resident memory moved between 47 MB and 56 MB in a sawtooth, with
  no upward trend, and CPU held at 13–15% for capture, resampling and
  recognition together. Recognition kept up throughout; no audio was dropped,
  so the backpressure path was not exercised live and is covered by tests
  instead. The interface stayed responsive with the transcript at several
  hundred segments.

### Interval 2, 3 and 4 checks, still current

Source discovery, multi-source selection, save-location restoration and
selected-application audio capture all still behave as recorded for those
intervals; the capture observations above were taken through the same path.

## Known limitations

- Interval 2, 3 and 4 limitations still hold.
- The transcript lives in memory for the length of a run and is lost when the
  run ends. Nothing is written to the chosen folder.
- Recognition needs an installed on-device model. Uninstalled locales are
  listed and disabled, and ScribeKit will not install one.
- Untranscribed time is reported as a single total, not as positions in the
  transcript, so a run with several gaps says how much was lost but not where.
- Bounded recovery from a recogniser failure is unit tested only; no live
  recogniser failure was reproduced.
- Confidence is not requested. `SpeechTranscriber` can attach a
  `transcriptionConfidence` attribute; it is left off until there is a review
  interface that would use it, rather than surfacing a number with nowhere to
  go.
- Stopping waits up to two seconds when the recogniser's results sequence does
  not end on its own, which happens when a run received no audio at all.
- Memory and CPU were observed, not benchmarked; formal energy measurement is
  a later interval.
- Dropping audio under backpressure has never happened on this machine, so the
  policy is proved by unit tests rather than by a live overload.

## Next interval

Interval 6: timestamped Markdown persistence. `TranscriptSegment` already
carries the run-relative timing and the partial/final distinction it needs, and
`LiveTranscriptModel` already knows the run's start date, so wall-clock
timestamps are that date plus the segment offset. It needs a writer holding a
session-length security-scoped lease on the chosen folder, `SessionDirectoryName`
and `SessionArtifactLayout` finally used to create a directory, batched
autosave, and a decision about how untranscribed gaps appear in the file.
