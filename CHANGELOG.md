## Unreleased

### Added

- Meeting domain models: `MeetingState`, `AudioRetentionMode`, `CaptureSource`
  and `MeetingSession`.
- Meeting configuration screen with title, audio retention and save location.
- Application source discovery behind a `CaptureSourceProviding` abstraction,
  with a ScreenCaptureKit-backed provider that enumerates shareable
  applications without creating a capture stream.
- Filtering policy that hides ScribeKit itself, unnamed or unidentified
  entries, background processes without an ordinary on-screen window, and
  duplicate processes of one application.
- Multi-application selection in the meeting setup screen, with loading, empty
  and error states, a manual Refresh, and removal of selections whose
  application is no longer running.
- Unit tests for the session lifecycle and model semantics, source filtering,
  discovery states and selection reconciliation.
- GitHub Actions workflow that builds and tests on macOS.
- Project documentation: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
